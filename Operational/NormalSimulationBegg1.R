#### Declare variables

# Reps = number of repetitions of experiment
Reps = 1000

# k = number of studies in series
Studies = c(2,4,6,8,10)

# subj = number of subjects in study, likely to be distributed
Subj = 100

# sd = study level standard deviation
True.sd = 5

# theta = population level mean
theta = 0

# tau.sq = between studies variance (can be squared due to sqrt() in normal draw), ?to be distributed
tau.sq = c(1,2,3)

# ?need to state I.sq in advance?

# Set up strength of publication bias selection
Begg_a <- 1.5
Begg_b <- 4
Begg_sided <- 1


# ID = total number of data points required, also used as an ID number. WILL NEED UPDATING
ID =  length(Subj) * length(True.sd) * length(theta) * length(tau.sq) * Reps * sum(Studies) 

### Set up data.table to store results

Normal.Simulation <- data.table(
  Unique_ID = c(1:ID),
  Rep_Number = integer(length = ID),
  Rep_Subj = integer(length = ID),
  Rep_sd = numeric(length = ID),
  Rep_theta = numeric(length = ID),
  Rep_tau.sq = numeric(length = ID),
  Rep_NumStudies = numeric(length = ID),
  Study_ID = integer(length = ID),
  Study_estimate = numeric(length = ID),
  Study_sd = numeric(length = ID),
  Study_n = integer(length = ID)
)

### Simulate
# Order of loops is based on calculation for ID above
# If number in each study is being drawn from distribution will need extra coding
